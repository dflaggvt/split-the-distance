      <h2>1. Service Overview</h2>
      <p>
        Split The Distance is a web application that helps users find a fair meeting point between two or more locations
        based on actual drive, bike, or walk time. The Service uses third-party mapping, geocoding, and place-search APIs
        to calculate midpoints and display nearby places of interest such as restaurants, cafes, and parks.
      </p>

      {/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */}
      <h2>2. Eligibility</h2>
      <p>
        You must be at least 13 years old to use the Service. By agreeing to these Terms you represent that: (a) you are
        at least 13 years old; (b) you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service; and (c) your use
        of the Service complies with all applicable laws and regulations.
      </p>

      {/* ------------------------------------------------------------------ */}
      <h2>3. Accounts &amp; Registration</h2>
      <p>
        Certain features of the Service require you to create an account. You may register using your Google or Apple
        account via our authentication provider, Supabase. When you register, you agree to provide accurate information
        and to keep it current. You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and
        for all activity that occurs under your account.

      <h2>4. Free &amp; Paid Features</h2>
      <p>
        The Service offers both free and paid features. Free features may be used without a subscription. Premium
        features require an active paid subscription.
      </p>
      <h3>4.1 Pricing</h3>
      <p>

        authorize us and our payment processor, Stripe, to charge the payment method on file for all recurring
        subscription fees and applicable taxes. You must cancel before the renewal date to avoid being charged for the
        next period.
