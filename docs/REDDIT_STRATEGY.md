# Reddit Strategy — Split The Distance

_Last updated: February 12, 2026_

---

## Approach

Authentic, value-first posts. No hard sells. Daryl posts from his personal account — real person sharing a tool he built. Engage in comments. Be helpful.

Every link includes a UTM tag so we can track what works:

## Audiences & Subreddits

### 🏙 Everyday Meetups (City/Regional Subs)

People meeting friends, family, or dates across town or across the metro area.

**Subreddits:**
- r/nyc (~500K+), r/LosAngeles (~400K+), r/chicago (~350K+), r/seattle (~350K+), r/Austin, r/boston, r/philadelphia, r/houston, r/Atlanta, r/Denver, r/Dallas, r/Portland, r/SanFrancisco, r/washingtondc
- r/newjersey, r/Connecticut, r/longisland, r/WestchesterNY

**Example post:**
> **Title:** Free tool that finds the halfway point between two locations by actual drive time
>
> My friend lives in Jersey City and I'm in Westchester. Every time we hang out, one of us gets stuck with the longer drive. I built a free tool that calculates the actual midpoint by drive time (not just distance) and shows restaurants, coffee shops, parks nearby. No signup, no ads. Just figured other people in the tri-state deal with this too.

### 👨‍👩‍👧 Family & Friends

Siblings, parents, old friends who live in different places and want to meet up fairly.

**Subreddits:**
- r/family (~50K), r/relationships (~4M+), r/relationship_advice (~10M+)
- r/Parenting (~4M+)

**Example post:**
> **Title:** My sister and I live an hour apart — this tool finds the fairest meeting spot by drive time
>
> We used to always default to whoever's town had better restaurants, which meant one of us drove 45 min and the other drove 15. I found a tool that calculates the actual halfway point by drive time and shows you what's nearby — restaurants, coffee, parks. Free, no signup. Changed our monthly hangouts.

### ❤️ Long-Distance Relationships

Partners, friends, or family separated by real distance.

**Subreddits:**
- r/LongDistance (~200K+), r/LongDistanceRelationships (~30K+)

**Example post:**
> **Title:** 3 hours apart? This free tool finds the perfect halfway spot with places to go
>
> My partner and I are about 3 hours apart and we kept picking the same Panera off the highway. This tool calculates the true midpoint by drive time (accounts for traffic and route), then shows restaurants, coffee shops, parks, and activities nearby. We've discovered some really cool small towns we never would've found. Free, no account needed.

### 👶 Co-Parents

Fair, practical exchange points. Huge recurring use case.

**Subreddits:**
- r/coparenting (~25K+), r/custody (~15K+), r/divorce (~150K+)
- r/SingleParents (~30K+)

**Example post:**
> **Title:** Free tool for finding a fair custody exchange point by actual drive time
>
> Sharing something that's helped a few people I know with custody exchanges. It calculates the true halfway point between two addresses based on drive time (not just distance on a map) and shows nearby spots — coffee shops, parks, gas stations. Useful for finding a consistent, fair meeting point that works for both sides. Free, no signup needed.

### 🚗 Road Trippers & Travelers

People planning stops along longer drives.

**Subreddits:**
- r/roadtrip (~700K+), r/travel (~9M+), r/RVliving (~50K+)
- r/gorving (~80K+), r/vandwellers (~500K+), r/camping (~3M+)

**Example post:**
> **Title:** Free tool that finds the halfway point on any drive and shows you what's nearby
>
> Planning a road trip and wanted to find a good stopping point. Most tools just give you a dot on the map — this one calculates the midpoint by actual drive time and shows restaurants, coffee, parks, gas, and hotels near that point. Has a "Local Only" filter to hide chains so you find the unique spots. No account, no cost.

### 🛒 Marketplace Buyers & Sellers

Safe, fair meeting spots for transactions.

**Subreddits:**
- r/FacebookMarketplace (~80K+), r/Flipping (~350K+), r/hardwareswap (~350K+)
- r/OfferUp, r/Craigslist, r/mercari

**Example post:**

>
> Quick tip for marketplace meetups — instead of arguing about who drives where, use this free tool to find the halfway point by drive time between you and the buyer/seller. It shows coffee shops, gas stations, and other public spots near the midpoint. Way better than a random parking lot. Free, no signup.

### 🏠 Real Estate Agents

Meeting clients across their territory. High-frequency use case.

**Subreddits:**
- r/realtors (~80K+), r/RealEstate (~1M+), r/RealEstateAgent (~15K+)
- r/CommercialRealEstate (~30K+)

**Example post:**
> **Title:** Any other agents use a midpoint tool for client meetings?
>
> I cover a pretty wide area and was tired of always driving 40+ minutes to meet clients on their side. Started using a free tool that finds the halfway point by actual drive time and shows coffee shops and restaurants nearby. Saves me probably 3-4 hours a week. No signup or cost. Curious if anyone else has tried something like this.

### 💼 Sales Professionals

Outside sales reps covering territories. Time = money.

- r/B2Bsales, r/SalesOperations

**Example post:**
> **Title:** Free tool that's saving me windshield time between prospect meetings
>
> For anyone in outside sales covering a territory — I've been using a tool that finds the drive-time midpoint between me and a prospect, then shows nearby meeting spots (coffee shops, restaurants). When I'm stacking meetings, I suggest the midpoint and it's easier to get a yes because neither of us is driving far. Small thing but it adds up.

Has a "Local Only" filter to hide chains. Free, no signup, no ads.
