## Project Details

### Product Description
*(Use this as the free-text description on the form)*

Split The Distance is a web app that finds the drive-time midpoint between two locations and helps users discover places to meet — with restaurants being our #1 searched category.

When two people live in different cities and want to meet for dinner, they enter their addresses and we calculate the fairest halfway point based on actual drive time (not geographic distance). We then show nearby restaurants, coffee shops, and other places at that midpoint.

We'd like to integrate OpenTable's Directory API to enrich our restaurant results with ratings, photos, price levels, and — most importantly — a "Reserve a Table" button. Every restaurant we display is shown to a user with high purchase intent: they've already committed to meeting someone and are actively choosing where to eat.

### Key Stats
- **Status:** Live in production
- **URL:** https://www.splitthedistance.com
- **Monthly users:** ~6,700+ sessions/month (growing organically, no paid ads)
- **Restaurant searches:** ~70% of users click the "Food" category — our most popular filter
- **Estimated restaurant impressions:** ~4,700+/month
- **User intent:** Extremely high — users are actively planning a meal meetup

### How We'd Use OpenTable Data
1. User searches for midpoint between two locations
2. User clicks "Food" filter to see nearby restaurants
3. We display restaurant cards with OpenTable data: name, rating, price level, photo, cuisine
4. Each restaurant card includes a prominent **"Reserve a Table"** button linking to OpenTable
5. User books reservation → we earn affiliate commission

### Why This Is a Good Fit for OpenTable
- **High-intent traffic:** 100% of our restaurant views are from users actively planning to dine out
- **Unique discovery channel:** We surface restaurants in locations users wouldn't normally search — midpoints between cities, highway corridors, suburban meeting spots
- **Incremental bookings:** These are reservations that wouldn't happen through OpenTable's existing channels — users discover restaurants they've never heard of
- **Clean integration:** "Reserve a Table" button would be the primary CTA on restaurant cards, driving maximum conversion
- **Growing platform:** Organic traffic increasing week over week with no paid marketing

### Product Type
- Web application (responsive, mobile-friendly)

### Industry Type
- Travel / Local Discovery / Maps

### Integration Plan
- Display OpenTable restaurant data via Directory API
- Show "Reserve a Table" buttons with affiliate tracking links
- Include "Powered by OpenTable" branding per affiliate terms
